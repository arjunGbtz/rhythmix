Rythm â€“ Simple Command Line Music Playlist Manager

Rythm is a minimal command-line tool to organize, manage, and play your local music playlists.
It was created out of personal need for a fast, no-nonsense way to handle music folders and playlists from the terminal.
Features

  - Create and delete playlists (each playlist is a folder)

  - Add songs to playlists (download from YouTube with yt-dlp)

  - List all playlists and songs in a playlist

  - Remove songs from playlists

  - Play songs using mpv

  - Simple folder-based structure, no database needed

Why?

I built this tool because I wanted a quick and easy way to manage my music playlists locally, without heavy music players or complex GUIs.
Maybe you find it useful too!
Requirements

  - Nim (to build/run the script)
